# ON THE HORIZON

On the Horizon tells the story of people whose lives were lost or forever altered by the twin
tragedies of **Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima**. Composed of poems about individual sailors who lost
their lives on the Arizona and about the citizens of Hiroshima who experienced unfathomable
horror.

> “I liked the feeling of love,' [Jonas] confessed. He glanced nervously at the speaker on the wall, reassuring himself that no one was listening. 'I wish we still had that,' he whispered. 'Of course,' he added quickly, 'I do understand that it wouldn't work very well. And that it's much better to be organized the way we are now. I can see that it was a dangerous way to live.'
> ...'Still,' he said slowly, almost to himself, 'I did like the light they made. And the warmth.”

> ― Lois Lowry, The Giver
